# Instagram Giveaway Comment Analysis & Product Restocking Prediction

## Project 1: Instagram Giveaway Comment Analysis for BolaPsd

### Overview
This project aims to analyze comments from an Instagram post exported to a CSV file to determine the winner of a giveaway competition. The primary goal is to identify the comment with the highest count.

### Files
- `result.csv`: CSV file containing the exported comments from the Instagram post.
- `psd.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for analyzing comments.

### Usage

## Project 2: Product Restocking Prediction with Machine Learning for Bola Psd

### Overview
This project utilizes datasets containing information on all products sold by Bolapsd, including sizes and quantities sold. The data is cleaned to retain only relevant information. A linear regression model is trained based on this data to predict the sizes and respective quantities of T-shirts to restock.

### Files
- `inventory sales.csv`: CSV file containing sales data including product information, sizes, and quantities sold.
- `size model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for training the linear regression model and making predictions.

### Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `size model.ipynb` to train the model and make predictions.

### Results
The trained linear regression model can predict the sizes and quantities of T-shirts to restock based on the desired restocking amount.
